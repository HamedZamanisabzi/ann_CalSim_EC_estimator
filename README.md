# ann_CalSim_EC_estimator
This code has been written in Python, adapted from an ANN model originally developed in Matlab.
A comprehensive version by Nicky Sandhu is available on GitHub (https://github.com/dwr-psandhu/ann_calsim). 
This updated version is based on preprocessed input data and incorporates the normalization process directly into the model building phase utilizing the TensorFlow library. As a result, the trained model can be exported in .pb format, enabling seamless integration and utilization in other programming environments, including Java within Eclipse.
