# ann_CalSim_EC_estimator
This code has been written in Python, adapted from an ANN model originally developed in Matlab. A comprehensive version by Nicky Sandhu is available on GitHub (https://github.com/dwr-psandhu/ann_calsim). 
This updated version is based on preprocessed input data and incorporates the normalization process directly into the model building phase utilizing the TensorFlow library. As a result, the trained model can be exported in .pb format, enabling seamless integration and utilization in other programming environments, including Java within Eclipse.
Also, this code is implementing the similar approach for normalization of the layers which has been used for the required delta outflow estimation (used within the CalSim) developed by Peyman Namadi (http://dwrrhapp0179.ad.water.ca.gov/gitea/peymanhn/CalSimDeltaOutFlowEstimator_CDOE).
